# Documentation, throttling, JWT and tests

- **Read** [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start
- After loading data from fixture you can use following superuser (or create another one by yourself):
  - Email: `admin.user@cinema.com`
  - Password: `1qazcde3`

In this task you will add tests and some advanced things to your project:
1. Add Swagger documentation for the whole project. 
It should include all query params described, such as:
   - filtering by title, genres, actors for movie
   - filtering by date, movie for movie session

**Remember:** don't forget to add `description` to your `OpenApiParameter`.

2. Add throttling settings, it should allow:
    - 10 requests per minute for unauthorized users
    - 30 requests per minute for authorized ones
3. Add a JWT support for the project.
4. Cover the whole `MovieViewSet` with tests.
5. Check if your code is clean. Delete imports, if you are not using them.
